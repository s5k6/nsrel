Discover namespace relationships.

    nsrel (<nsfile> | <pid> <nstype>)

Starting from the specified namespace, print (where applicable) its
namespace ID, type, parent namespace ID, owning user namespace ID, and
owning user ID.  Recursively close over parent and owning namespaces.

In the output, `-` means not applicable, `<not implemented>` hints at
the kernel lacking a feature, and `<oos>` refers to namespaces that
are out of scope (which also applies to the non-existent parent of an
initial namespace).

For more information, see ioctl_ns(2), user_namespaces(7).
