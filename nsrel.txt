Discover namespace relationships.

    nsrel (<nsfile> | <pid> <nstype>)

Starting from the specified namespace, print (where applicable) its
namespace ID, namespace type, parent namespace ID, owning user
namespace ID, and owning user ID.  Recursively close over parent and
owning namespaces.

In the output, `-` means not applicable, `<not implemented>` hints at
the kernel lacking a feature, `<oos>` refers to namespaces that are
out of scope (which also applies to the non-existent parent of an
initial namespace), and `<parent>` is used iff the user namespace
equals the parent namespace (which is conceptually wierd, but reported
this way by ioctl).

For more information, see ioctl_ns(2), user_namespaces(7).
